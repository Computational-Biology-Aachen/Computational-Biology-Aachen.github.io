## About me

While modelling in the biological field is a young venture, many examples of successful models exist. They all vary in complexity, format, and intended use; therefore, overseeing what already exists can be challenging. Over the years, I had to research and compare not only ways to model photosynthesis but also models themselves. While these were often tedious tasks, they allowed me to gain a massive insight into the wide world of photosynthetic modelling. Although I gained knowledge and experience from these tedious efforts, I have a personal project aimed at making our area of expertise more accessible to others. I view photosynthetic modelling as a valuable resource for enhancing the understanding of plant sciences. Therefore, I am working on my master's thesis right now, which will create a database of already existing models, go into depth about what they entail, and give way to a quicker method of using these models. This database should be easy to use and understand. Therefore, I will make it accessible as a website that follows modern styles while providing all the essential information. To further enhance the experience, the website will also include an intuitive and smart way to search for and compare these models. This comparison will consist of different ways to test a model, which will be a significant part of my Thesis: “Green Sloth: A Web-Database of Photosynthetic Models for the Lazy”.
