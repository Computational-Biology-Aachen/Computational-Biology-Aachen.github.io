## About me
Huy got his Bachelor degree in Biology from Vietnam National University of
Science, and he finished his Master thesis within our group. He is now a PhD
student in CEPLAS Graduate School. Huy investigates vascular plant
photosynthesis under natural light conditions with a focus on
non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and its interdependence with temperature.
Using mathematical modeling and experimental approaches, he aims to determine
key factors that define NPQ kinetics and quantify secondary effect of temperature
during light fluctuations.
