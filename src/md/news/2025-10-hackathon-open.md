How do genetic differences shape the way plants capture light, process carbon, and survive drought? Join us for **“Hacking for Photosynthesis: From Field Photosynthesis to Genetic Architecture”**: a unique, fast-paced hackathon bringing together data scientists, plant researchers, software engineers, and innovators to uncover the links between genotypic variation and photosynthetic performance.

**When?** 09. - 13.03.2026

**Where?** International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria

**Registration has been extended until** 16th of November 2025
