This summer, our PhD student Nguyen Quang Huy had the chance to go to the IHRS in France and work with Prof. David Macherel from University of Angers. Prof. Macherel has established advanced technique in temperature measurement within live plant cells using signal from the fluorescence protein GFP [1]. During his time in France, Huy has used the technique to have estimation of chloroplast temperature, using transgenic plants that express GFP inside the chloroplast. The technique allows real time tracking of temperature changes within fluctuating environments, especially with light intensity. The trip was funded via the mobility funding of CEPLAS Graduate School.
