On September 2025, our PhD student Quang Huy Nguyen has participated in the retreat of Jan Ingenhousz Institute in Wageningen, The Netherlands. The annual meeting gathered reserachers in photosynthesis to discuss about lastest results and how these advances help the institute reach its goals of improving photosynthesis and crop production. The meeting had an intimate setting, with active discussions across varied topics, from open-access platform of photosynthesis data and large scale measurment of photosynthesis performance, to novel mechanics of photosynthesis reponse to environmental stress. Our student Huy presented a poster with his latest development of a temperature-depdendent mathematical model for photosynthesis and the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) process.
