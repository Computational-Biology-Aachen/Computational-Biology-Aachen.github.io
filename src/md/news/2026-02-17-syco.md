The exam season has begun at the RWTH Aachen, which also means our intensive two-week course on Systems and Computational Biology (SyCo) is back for its 2026 edition! From February 17th to 27th, students will dive deep into the fascinating world of systems biology, learning about mathematical modeling, data analysis, and computational techniques used to understand complex biological systems. At the end the course, small groups of students will show their findings in a small poster session, maybe we will find some new ways to look at out biological data and small sugar metabolism model!

We wish all students a good exam season, and our students of SyCo a great time learning about systems and computational biology! See you there!
