The German Research Foundation (DFG) announced today funding of new Collaborative Research Centres (CRC).
We are thrilled that our CRC 1535 MibiNet “Microbial networking – from organelles to cross-kingdom communities” recieved funding for the next four years. Congratulations to our Spokes People Prof. Dr. Michael Feldbrügge from Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf and Prof. Dr. Julia Frunzke from Jülich Research Center (FZJ).

The CRC 1535 includes six cooperation partners, including RWTH Aachen, Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf, Research Center Jülich, the University of Bielefeld, the University of Cologne and the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne.

Within this project we will create MibiNeⓍt - Integrated Research Training Group. MibiNeⓍt will offer targeted and interdisciplinary high-quality training for the next generation of microbiologists and will provide a tailored 4-year doctoral training programme. Numerous partners are opening right now their recruitment process INCLUDING OUR LAB!
