How do genetic differences shape the way plants capture light, process carbon, and survive drought? Join us for **“Hacking for Photosynthesis: From Field Photosynthesis to Genetic Architecture”**: a unique, fast-paced hackathon bringing together data scientists, plant researchers, software engineers, and innovators to uncover the links between genotypic variation and photosynthetic performance.

**When?** 09. - 13.03.2026

**Where?** International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria

**Registration open until?** 9th of November 2025

<a href="https://computational-biology-aachen.github.io/2026-photosynthesis-hackathon/" style="color: var(--secondary); font-family: sans-serif; display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Join us and be part of a new community driving innovation at the intersection of genetics, physiology, and data!</a>


**Funding**: We would like to thank the the Mastercard Foundation and University of Cambridge Climate Resilience and Sustainability Research Fund JanIngenhousz Intitute under JII Open Challenge Fund for the generous funding of this hackathon.
