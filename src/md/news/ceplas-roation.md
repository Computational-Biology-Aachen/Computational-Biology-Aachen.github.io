Our Lab offers short research stays for doctoral candidates of the Cluster of Excellence on Plant Science choosing their doctoral project. Starting today, selected candidates will have a chance to get a peak to the world of computational biology and enhance their skills in scientific modelling with Python. We welcome our first student Abdulkabir Omeiza and wish him all the best during his rotation.
