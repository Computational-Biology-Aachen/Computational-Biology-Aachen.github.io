We are pleased to announce that one of the fourteen newly awarded <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/root/forschung/angebote-fuer-forschende/qualifizierung-und-karriere/rwth-center-for-young-academics/~botjje/rwth-port-to-europe-postdoc-fellowships/?lidx=1" style="color: var(--secondary); font-family: sans-serif; display: block; margin-bottom: 1rem;">RWTH Port to Europe Postdoc Fellow</a> will join our lab.

Dr. El Hadji Malick Cisse, a young plant physiologist with a strong footing in computational biology, will begin his fellowship within our group.

Dr. Cisse’s research focuses on plant responses to single, combined, and sequential abiotic stresses. He integrates morphological, physiological, and molecular data with computational approaches to uncover stress-adaptation mechanisms in annual crops and forest trees. His scientific outlook has been shaped by thinkers such as Max Planck, Michael Faraday, Albert Einstein, Louis Pasteur, and Auguste Comte, guided by the principle that “science advances one funeral at a time”.

In joining RWTH Aachen University and our group, he emphasised the strong theoretical and computational orientation of our research. His interest in modelling stress-memory and gene regulatory modules led him to the MxlPy framework developed within our lab—an alignment that made RWTH the ideal place to pursue his fellowship project.

We look forward to welcoming Dr. Cisse to Aachen and to supporting his research as part of the Port to Europe Fellowship programme.
