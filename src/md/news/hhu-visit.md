On 05.06.2023 Jun.-Prof. Dr. Anna Matuszyńska, Tanvir Hassan and Siraz Kader visited the ZSL of HHU and got a guided tour and insight into their research with cyanobacteria. In correspondence with Andreas Nakielski and Prof. Dr. Ilka Maria Axmann we talked about the algae facade project and planned the next approach of the project using the "flat panel reactors" available there. ZSL provided us with one of their reactors to design first experiments and understand the structure. Overall, we were very pleased with the visit, were able to exchange ideas effectively for the project, and learned quite a bit. Lastly, we used the trip to visit the local botanical garden.
