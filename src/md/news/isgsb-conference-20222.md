We have just came back from Innsbruck, Austria, where we attended the International Study Group for Systems Biology ISGSB 2022. It was a very special meeting for us, as Prof. Matuszynska had a pleasure to give an Openning Lecture titled "From a shy plant to a gland: computational models of photosynthesis".
During her talk Prof. Matuszyńska reminded about the importance of simplicity in modelling and gave a brief overview of the research activities taken in the last year by our group. Although the scientific part sparkled an interesting discussion about the bioenergetics of plant cells, the show was mostly stolen by the video of a rescued turtle returning to the Ocean, that was made during the Summer School in Kenya. On the following days the rest of our group had also a chance to explain their work in details. Both of our PhD students, Chloe and Tobias, presented scientific posters about their research. As with every ISGSB meeting, it was hard to say goodbye. We can't wait for the next edition, that for now is planned to take place in Stellenbosch, South Africa.
