We are delighted to share that Team CPBL participated in the European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ECMTB) in Toledo, Spain from 21-26July 2024. For researchers in mathematical and theoretical biology, this prestigious conference is widely recognized as the premier gathering place for leading experts from across the globe. During the conference, Dr. Tim Nies gave an insightful talk in the Plant Biology session. He shared his most recent findings on a mathematical model of photoinhibition, which provided new perspectives in the area. Tobias Pfennig delivered an outstanding contribution talk to the Microbiology session on *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803's photosynthesis under various light conditions. Additionally, team members Tanvir Hassan and Marvin van Aalst presented their research through posters, which have garnered significant attention, sparking engaging discussions and opening doors to potential collaborations with other participants.
