It is a great pleasure to inform that we have been awarded with the first round of the Sustainability Funds for the design and use of a facade made of microalgae or cyanobacteria to i) improve the thermal insulation of a building, ii) to bind the greenhouse gas CO2 for the production of the biomass and oxygen, iii) depending on the oragism used, for the alternative production of nitrogen to form fertilizer. The project requires an interdisciplinary expertise and our group will collect real-time data from teh facade to develop new models of algal growth and production. The project is coordinated by Prof. Lars Lauterbach.
