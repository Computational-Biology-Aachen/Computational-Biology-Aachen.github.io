We welcome Quang Huy Nguyen a doctoral candidate within the Cluster of Excellence on Plant Science (CEPLAS) Graduta School (https://www.ceplas.eu/en/home/). Huy have spent the last three weeks working with Prof. Ute Armbruster (https://www.biologie.hhu.de/institute-und-abteilungen/institute-hhu/photosynthese) and collecting experimental data on tomato. In the next three weeks he will analyse this data in our lab and aim at using computational model to further understand their meaning. We are very happy to host Huy and we hope he will enjoy his scientific stay with us.
