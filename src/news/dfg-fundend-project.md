We are pleased to report that our Lab is a part of one of the seven newly funded DFG research groups! Under the leadership of Prof. Michael Hippler from the University of Münster we will study the photosynthetic proton motor force (or PMF for short). PMF is at the heart of energy metabolism and drives most cellular functions and is as universal as the genetic code. In plants, PMF plays a central role in the functioning of oxygenic photosynthesis. The goal of this project is to find out how the assembly and modulation of PMF is regulated to optimize photosynthesis under variable conditions and our team will support teh computational endavours.
