The summer semester is here! This means the junior professorship for computational biology offers new courses to all students interested.

This summer semester, we offer, among others, two new exciting courses for students:

    1. We are part of the module Ethik in den Biowissenschaften. Here, we will give two lectures about using computational models and AI in Biology. Can we use computational tools to make statements and predictions about biological processes? And what are the ethical implications? If you are interested, please join us!
    2. We are happy to announce the course "Photosynthetic Systems in Architecture" (PhoSA). In this course, various groups from biology and the Institute of Landscape Architecture worked together to explain the importance of photosynthetic organisms for a sustainable future and their application in architecture. This year's practical phase will be a project in which students work together to construct, measure, and analyze a green facade. If you are interested, we will be happy to see you on the course!
