Dear students, we wish you every success for the upcoming exam period. Study hard, be diligent and don't neglect yourselves amidst all the stress! Meet up with friends, enjoy nature and take breaks. Exciting new courses are also waiting for you in the coming semester (summer semester 25), such as “Photosynthetic Systems in Architecture” (PhoSA). In this course, we are working with various groups from biology and the Institute of Landscape Architecture to explain the importance of photosynthetic organisms for a sustainable future. The aim is to impart not only biological knowledge, but also applications in architecture. Have we piqued your interest? Then simply register. We look forward to hearing from you!
