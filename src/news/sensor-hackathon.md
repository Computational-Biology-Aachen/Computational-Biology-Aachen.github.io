Cables, microcontrollers, and sensors! Today, our team member Tanvir Hassan showed us how to use Arduinos (small microcontrollers) and connect them to sensors. We had a lot of fun and built a small device to measure if our plants were well watered! Hopefully, this will help us so that our office plants will more frequently survive. We organized the hackathon to prepare for the new Master course PhoSA - Photosynthetic Systems in Architecture, a collaborative module with the architecture faculty.
