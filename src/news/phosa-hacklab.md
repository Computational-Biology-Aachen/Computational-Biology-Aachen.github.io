The Computational Life Science Lab at RWTH Aachen has been awarded funding in the first round of the **ENHANCE Alliance Testbed competition** for the project *PhoSA HackLab: Emulating Scientific Consultancy for Eco-Innovative Cities*.

The project is led by **Prof. Dr. Anna Matuszyńska** and **Dr. Tim Nies** (Computational Life Science, RWTH Aachen) in close collaboration with **Prof. Axel Timpe** (Chair of Landscape Architecture, RWTH Aachen).
It builds on the interdisciplinary course *Photosynthetic Systems in Architecture (PhoSA)*, funded through **Leitlinie 2024**, which connects biology and architecture students in developing sustainable urban solutions such as algae façades, vertical gardens, and green walls.
With the HackLab extension, the initiative will expand to include engineering and physics students from partner universities. **Dr. Sebastian Wachowski** ([Politechnika Gdańska](https://pg.edu.pl)) and **Dr. Vira Bondar** (ETH Zürich) will join as co-implementing partners, bringing their expertise in nanotechnology, materials engineering, and physics.

The HackLab will take the form of a two-day international hackathon where students act as a simulated consultancy. Interdisciplinary teams will prototype sensor systems for green infrastructure—covering automated irrigation, adaptive lighting, real-time monitoring of CO₂ uptake and microclimate, and data interfaces for computational modeling.

Running from **August 2025 to August 2026**, the HackLab is designed not only as a one-time event but as a recurring part of the PhoSA program, ensuring continuity and long-term impact. Students will gain first-hand experience in interdisciplinary teamwork, project-based learning, and applying scientific expertise to real-world sustainability challenges.
