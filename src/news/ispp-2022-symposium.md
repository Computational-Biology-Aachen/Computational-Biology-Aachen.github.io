Our Lab members, Anna and Tobias, has joined the 17th International Symposium on Phototrophic Prokaryotes (ISPP2022) organised in Liverpool and presented there posters on the ongoing and planned modelling work on cyanobacteria. We have finally met in person our long collaborators and launched new, interesting ones. We are already looking for the next edition in three years.
