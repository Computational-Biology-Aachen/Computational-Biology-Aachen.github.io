Topic of this year's trip: Mathematics in Computation, as we have attended there the 1st workshop on Artificial Inteligence (AI) and mathematics. Remarkably, CWI, located in Amsterdam Science Park, is the place of the first European internet connection and the creation site of the programming language Python.
