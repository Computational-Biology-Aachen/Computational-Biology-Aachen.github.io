What an incredible night! Night Science was a smashing success, and we are absolutely thrilled by the overwhelming turnout. From start to finish, the energy in the lab was electric, and the curiosity of every participant made it all the more rewarding.

We kicked things off by showcasing how we collect experimental data and use it to calibrate mathematical models. Many of you stepped up to perform your own measurements, proving yourselves to be budding scientists!

The photosynthetically active bacteria stole the show as we delved into their fascinating world, exploring their surprising roles and behaviors within their communities. Game theory took center stage as we explained how some organisms "cheat" their way to survival, sparking lively discussions.

The Rock-Paper-Scissors showdown between participants and our Arduino-Bot was an absolute blast. While the Humans put up a valiant fight, we’ll leave the final score a mystery—just know the competition was fierce!

Thank you all for joining us, for your curiosity, and for your enthusiasm. We’re positively exhausted but couldn’t be happier about the interest and engagement. Until next time, keep asking questions and exploring the wonders of science!

Stay tuned for more events, and we can’t wait to see you again!
