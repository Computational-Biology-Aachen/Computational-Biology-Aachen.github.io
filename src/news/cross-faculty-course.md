# Computational Photosynthesis: from in vivo to in silico

![New cross-faculty course](/news/crossfaculty.jpeg)

With great pleasure, we announce that our application for the "Leitlinie Lehre" program, which supports the improvement and development of interdisciplinary teaching ideas, has been approved. In our newly developed course "Computational Photosynthesis: from in vivo to in silico," we will team up with the institutes of landscape architecture (represented by Dr.-Ing. Axel Timpe), applied microbiology (Univ.-Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Lars Lauterbach), and biology III (plant biology, Prof. Dr. Ulrich Schaffrath) to open for students not only the exciting world photosynthesis biology but also its importance for tackling social problems in our modern world.
The course will be designed as a simulated research project and will consist of lectures, seminars, and practicals. While lectures give a general overview of photosynthesis and green elements in architecture and seminars will consist of presentations held by students but also from invited (industry) or internal guests that provide insights into their research and work, in the practical, students will work in focus groups (e.g., construction, measuring, and simulation), guided by experts, to create, improve, and analyze a future-oriented application of photosynthetic organisms, such as a vertical garden or algae facade that was proposed as a sustainable application of organisms in the construction of buildings and their greenery.
The newly developed course will start next summer semester (2025), and we hope that we can catch your interest. If you have any questions, please write Dr. Tim Nies or Prof. Dr. Anna Matuszyńska.

Additionally, please check this website from time to time. We will post regular updates on the course's planning.
