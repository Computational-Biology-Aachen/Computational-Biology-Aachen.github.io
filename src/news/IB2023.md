Team CPBL attended the 17th International Symposium on Integrative Bioinformatics held at Łukasiewicz – PORT in Wrocław, Poland, from September 6 to 8 2023. The symposium was an enlightening experience as it brought together experts and researchers from across the globe to explore the latest advancements in bioinformatics and its integration with various fields of science. Professor Anna, a prominent figure in the field, captivated the audience as a keynote speaker, sharing her profound insights into the Computational Models of Photosynthesis. Her presentation was both inspiring and thought-provoking, setting the tone for the entire symposium. During the conference, our team had the privilege of presenting two posters that highlighted our latest research contributions. Engaging with fellow attendees, receiving constructive feedback, and exchanging ideas were a gratifying experience. Throughout the three days, the event not only enriched the participants´ knowledge but also fostered valuable connections, leaving the team inspired and eager to continue exploring the exciting frontiers of this rapidly evolving field.
