*Düsseldorf, August 1, 2024* – Prof. Matuszyńska together with researchers from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) and Michigan State University (USA) have published a new perspective on the future of synthetic biology, focusing on the potential of computational biology to support synthetic design. Funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the SFB 1535 MibiNet initiative, this paper highlights the promising developments and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.


**Understanding Synthetic Biology**
Synthetic biology is an innovative field that views biological complexity as networks of parts, devices, and systems with predetermined functionalities. This approach has significantly impacted both fundamental and applied research, allowing for the synthesis and transfer of DNA and RNA across different organisms. The field is advancing towards constructing highly complex networks, such as artificial communities of synthetic organisms.

**The Role of Computational Biology**
The perspective paper, emphasizes the integration of computational biology into synthetic biology. Computational models play a crucial role in understanding and managing the complexity of biological systems. However, there is still much untapped potential for incorporating these models into the synthetic design process.
The authors highlight recent advances in computer-aided design of microbial communities and propose a modular modelling approach. This approach shifts the focus from single organism-centered methods to emphasizing the functional roles of organisms within a community. By assembling synthetic biological systems using these modular computational models, researchers can better tailor organisms to fulfill specific functions within a community.


**Promising Examples and Future Directions**
The paper presents prominent examples from various labs demonstrating the current progress in the field. These examples underscore that we are on the right track towards fully integrating computational models with synthetic biology. The proposed shift in perspective aligns with synthetic biology strategies and presents exciting opportunities for designing artificial communities.

**Collaborative Effort and Funding**
This perspective is a result of a collaboration between RWTH Aachen University, HHU Düsseldorf and Michigan State University, showcasing the importance of international scientific cooperation. The research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the SFB 1535 MibiNet "Microbial networking – from organelles to cross-kingdom communities" initiative.
