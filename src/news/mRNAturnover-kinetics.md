We are happy to share the results of the latest collaborative project that was published today in the PNAS. The group of Prof. Michael Feldbrüger focused on understanding the regulation of mRNA in a fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis. Such knowledge is essential for developing new strategies against pathogen infections. Our group implemented a well established single-compartment model and systematically investigated the impact of mRNA stability on gene expression. For numerical integration, we implemented the model in Python and performed a set of experiments in silico to test the effect of perturbing either of the rates. The code is openly available under:
