## About me

I am interested in the cross-section of biology and informatics, quantitative biology.  My focus in this broad spectrum lies in modeling photosynthesis in higher plants. Currently, I am part of the research group GoPMF, which deals with the investigation of proton motive force (PMF) across differing organisms, ranging from cyanobacteria to plants. PMF is highly important for the organism’s adaptation to fluctuating external factors. PMF consists of two components: 1. the chemical gradient (∆pH) and the electrical gradient (∆Ψ). The electrical gradient has been neglected in most photosynthesis models and recently gained a lot of traction in research. To not only support but incorporate the newly found data, I want to create an in silico platform in the form of mathematical models, through which one can derive hypotheses about the general pillars of PMF across differing organisms but also the distinctive features of PMF in each organism.

For me, PMF in higher plants poses the key to unlocking the plants’ potential to maximize yield and minimize damage. As most crops are grown outside under fluctuating conditions, understanding how to manipulate PMF and its factors is required to maximize crop yield. In an evergrowing population, increasing crop yield to aid with starvation worldwide is crucial. This is why this project is very dear to me and why I enjoy working on it.
