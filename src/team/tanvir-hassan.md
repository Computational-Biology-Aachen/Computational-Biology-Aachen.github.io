## About me

As a member of MiBiNet, a collaborative research group focused on microbial community networks, I study kinetics and evolutionary dynamics of cross-kingdom microbial consortia. My research emphasizes metabolic interactions among heterotrophic members within microbial ecosystems, particularly through the co-cultivation of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic partners. To investigate their complex community structure, I apply computational models and mathematical frameworks that enable the simulation of community dynamics in silico. This approach facilitates a systematic exploration of how resource availability, metabolic trade-offs, and competition influence the structure, composition, and stability of our designed synthetic cross-kingdom community connected through nutrient exchange. The core objective of my work is to develop a generalized model within an evolutionary game-theoretical framework, examining how three distinct metabolic strategies of heterotrophs —Public Metabolizer, Private Metabolizer, and Cheater (also referred to as Defector or Free Rider) affect the ecological dynamics, community composition, and overall stability of microbial consortia.
