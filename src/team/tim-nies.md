## About me

I am interested in abiotic and biotic factors that determine photosynthetic efficiency in a dynamic environment. To analyze the complex link between photosynthetic performance and environmental factors, I use computer models and mathematical analysis techniques that allow me to simulate and study biological phenomena in silico. For example, I am interested in light damage leading to reduced photosynthetic performance and crop yield, or in the control of carbon sequestration in different light environments. To validate my mathematical representation of photosynthesis, I use various methods from data science to extract information from experimental measurements. By repeating the process of validation, simulation, and prediction, I refine my models in a progressive process.My long-term goal is to understand photosynthesis and its associated processes at all temporal and spatial scales, and ultimately to develop new hypotheses for improving crop yields and biotechnological uses of photosynthetic organisms.
