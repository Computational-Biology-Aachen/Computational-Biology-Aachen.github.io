## Does phytoplankton protect itself from stress during photosynthesis in the same way as plants?
Our collaborative project on the role of KEA3 in regulating photoprotection in diatoms has been published in New Phytologist. Congratulations to the whole team, especially to the first author Claire Seydoux, and Dr. Giovanni Finazzi, CEA Grenoble, France, for a great collaborative project.

The complete description of our contribution, the computational model of non-photochemical quenching in diatoms, can be found on the git [repository.](https://gitlab.com/matuszynska/npq-diatoms2020)
