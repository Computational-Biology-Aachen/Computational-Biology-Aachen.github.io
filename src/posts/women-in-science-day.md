Participating in the CEPLAS Women in Plant Sciences event as a Speaker was a deeply gratifying experience. As the youngest professor among the panelists, I had the privilege of offering a fresh perspective alongside Prof. Ilka Axmann (Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf) and Prof. Ute Höcker (University of Cologne), whose careers collectively span over three decades. Together, we shared invaluable insights into our respective journeys within the realm of plant sciences. Prof. Axmann's captivating narrative illuminated the power of dreaming big and aiming for Nobel prizes, while Prof. Höcker's tale of pursuing opportunities across continents in an era predating internet underscored the resilience and adaptability required in academia.

For my part, I delved into the intricacies of my non-linear career path, detailing the various steps that ultimately led me to accept a call for a professorship here, at RWTH Aachen University . Our discussions traversed diverse career choices, challenges, and triumphs, offering a holistic view of the evolving landscape of academic pursuits in plant sciences. An invaluable perspective on the challenges that we have overcome so far as women working in previously highly dominated men environment were spontaneously provided by a Special Guest in the Audience, Prof. Dr. Sieglinde Ott (https://www.hhu.de/die-hhu/presse-und-marketing/aktuelles/archiv-newsmeldungen-hhu-seit-1997/archivmeldungen-detailansicht/antarktis-weltraum-duesseldorf-der-lange-weg-der-flechten), an astrobiologist and retired professor at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf.

Through engaging with the audience, we not only provided guidance and inspiration but also fostered meaningful connections among aspiring female researchers. It was a privilege to contribute to an event dedicated to supporting the career advancement of early-career female scientists within the CEPLAS community. As I shared insights from my own journey and showcased the work of my lab, I hope to have empowered and encouraged the next generation of women in plant sciences to pursue their ambitions with passion, confidence and determination.
