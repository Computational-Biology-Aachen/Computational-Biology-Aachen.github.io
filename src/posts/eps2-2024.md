The Second European Congress on Photosynthesis Research (EPS2) took place in Padova, Italy, from June 24th to 28th. This congress allows researchers from many disciplinary scientific areas to come together and discuss the future of photosynthetic research. The invitees ranged from ecologists to computational biologists to molecular biologists, all of whom tackle the same big hurdle: photosynthesis.

Our group made a significant impact at the congress. Tobias Pfenning's talk on “Shedding light on blue-green photosynthesis: A wavelength-dependent mathematical model of photosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803” joined with Quang Huy Nguyen's poster presentation during the preliminary program for young researchers was well-received. In the main session, Dr Tim Nies' talk “A mathematical model of photoinhibition: exploring the impact of quenching processes” was a highlight supported by the collective efforts of Tobias Pfennig, Quang Huy Nguyen, Marvin van Aalst, and Elouen Corvest, each with their poster, further showcased our group's achievements.

Overall, the congress was very successful, allowing our group to build bridges with groups worldwide and broaden the horizons of each of our attending group members. Additionally, it was an incredibly eye-opening event for Elouen Corvest as it was not only his first time attending a conference where he had to present himself, but he also won one of the five poster awards awarded by the committee with the support of the Jan IngenHousz Institute. Therefore, we congratulate Elouen and hope it was an educative experience for him and the other members of our well-represented group!
